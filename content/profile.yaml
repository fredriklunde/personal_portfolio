  about: |
    Convinced Software Craftsman, truly belive developers needs to focus to get it right from the start and then keep on building good software. Its ok not to get it right the first time, 
    but before production push, code needs to be cleaned. Im building an IT-Consultancy company where software development is the core of everything, and where we truly take pride in what we do.

    We are helping our customers to succeed with their software, in a sustainable and long-term way.
